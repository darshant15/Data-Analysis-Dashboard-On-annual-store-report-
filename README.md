## KPI Questions for the Excel Dashboard Project

1. What is the total revenue generated over the selected period?

2. Which region has the highest total sales?

3. Which product category performs best in terms of revenue?

4. Who are the top-performing salespersons by total revenue?

5. What are the monthly sales trends over time?

6. How do sales compare across different regions?

7. What is the average revenue per unit sold?

8. What are the top 5 products by sales volume or revenue?

9. How does revenue distribution look across different months or quarters?

10. What is the growth rate or trend in monthly or quarterly sales?

## Process
 1. Data Import

Import the sales dataset from a .csv or .xlsx file

Verify headers and data types

2. Data Cleaning

Remove duplicates

Handle missing or inconsistent data

Standardize entries (e.g., region names, product names)

Convert date columns to proper date format

3. Data Transformation

Add calculated fields (e.g., Total Revenue = Units Sold * Unit Price)

Create helper columns for Month and Year using:

=TEXT([@Date], "MMMM")

=YEAR([@Date])

4. Data Analysis

Create PivotTables for:

Total sales by region

Monthly sales trends

Product-wise performance

Generate PivotCharts (column, line, pie) from PivotTables

5. Dashboard Creation

Design a new sheet named “Dashboard”

Add key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, monthly sales, etc.

Insert dynamic charts linked to PivotTables

Use slicers for filtering data by region, year, or product

Apply formatting for a clean, professional layout

6. Review & Final Touches

Test interactivity of the dashboard

Ensure accuracy of calculations and visualizations

Save and export the final project file.
